        <h2>Why Cape Town?</h2>
        <h3>Cape Town, the Mother City</h3>
        <p>
           Legend has it that Cape Town earned the name "The Mother City" as the first European settlement in South Africa, cradled between ocean and mountain. Nestled at the foot of the iconic Table Mountain, the city grew where two great oceans meet, shaped by centuries of culture, trade, and resilience.
        </p>
        <p>Today, beyond the vibrant markets, art-filled streets, and global cuisine, you can still trace the city's soul—from the cobbled lanes of Bo-Kaap to the sweeping views at the mountain’s summit, where land, sea, and sky stretch endlessly into the horizon.
